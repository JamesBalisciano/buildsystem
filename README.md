# buildsystem
Location of reusable build script files, groovy libraries, and other infrastructure items needed for LabVIEW build servers.

This library is built in LabVIEW 2014, and assumes the use of the [Wiresmith LabVIEW CLI](https://github.com/JamesMc86/LabVIEW-CLI) package.

Note: National Instruments added command line interface actions for LabVIEW in the [LabVIEW 2018 release](http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361R-01/lvupgrade/labview_features/), based in part on this package.  Once installed, it supports LabVIEW 2014 and later.  This potentially replaces both the Wiresmith CLI and this package.
